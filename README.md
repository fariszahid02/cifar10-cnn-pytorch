#  CNN with and without Batch Normalization on CIFAR-10

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to evaluate the impact of **Batch Normalization** on training stability and performance. The project also includes visualizations of filters and feature maps to better understand what the model learns.

##  Key Components

- Built two CNN models (with and without Batch Normalization)
- Trained models on CIFAR-10 with early stopping
- Evaluated model performance using validation accuracy and loss
- Visualized:
  - Convergence graphs
  - Convolutional filters
  - Feature maps from selected layers

##  Dataset

- CIFAR-10 (downloaded via `torchvision.datasets`)
- 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes (50k training, 10k test)


##  Objectives

- Understand the effect of Batch Normalization on CNNs
- Explore feature learning through filter and activation map visualization
- Practice model evaluation, early stopping, and interpretability

##  Visualizations

- Training vs validation loss convergence
- Filters from convolutional layers
- Feature maps generated by input images
